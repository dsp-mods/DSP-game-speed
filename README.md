## Dyson Sphere Program: Game Speed Mod   
This mod lets you set the speed of the game.


### Features
- Added User interface to set the speed of the game (Bottom Right corner).
- Option for default, 2x, 3x speed.
- This mod affects in-game time counter as well.

### Updates
#### V0.7.1
- Added config file("Game-Folder"/BepInEx/config/dsp.mods.gamespeed.cfg) to set custom speed (A current mod user request on GitHub). Use Combo Key(Left Alt/Left Ctrl) + 0 to toggle your custom speed setting. Not recommended to use very large numbers as it gets difficult to control player.
- Choose between Left Alt(Default) or Left Ctrl for Combo Key in the config file(0 for Left Alt, or 1 for Left Ctrl). 

#### v0.6.1
- Added Keybinds ( Left Alt + 1, Left Alt + 2, or Left Alt + 3 to set game speed to 1x, 2x and 3x respectively)
- Fixed speed display text on top right overwritting steam profile name.
